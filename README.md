## About the Code

This project is a modular bot, made using Python 3 and the following libraries:

- [python-telegram-bot](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot)
- [aiohttp](https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/)
- [lxml](https://lxml.de/)

## How the bot works

The bot scrapes a student marks table and converts the list of students' marks into an HTML table. For example:

<img
  src="media/university_page_example.png"
  alt="university_page_example"
  width="400"/>

The list of students' marks will look like this in HTML:

<img
  src="media/html_table.png"
  alt="html_table"
  width="400"/>

## Features

- The bot allows the user to obtain an HTML file of a single student's marks by providing their ID number using the `/html` command.
- The bot also sends a normal text message of a student's marks to the user.
- The bot allows the user to obtain HTML files of all students in a particular year using the `/year1`, `/year2`, `/year3`, `/year4`, and `/year5` commands.
- The bot can also generate an HTML file of all students whose ID numbers are within a certain range using the `/in_range` command.
- The bot can work in inline mode, so you can type your bot username then the ID number of a students _(you should enable inline mode in your bot from [@BotFather](https://telegram.me/botfather) settings > Inline Mode > Turn on)_.

## Prerequisites

> **Notes:**
>
> - You can change the start message in the `config.json` file
> - Also you can specify the html file caption (when it sended to the user) and the HTML sign (which appears on the top of the HTML file)
> - To convert an HTML file to PDF, here's some websites I've tested and was working fine with Arabic:
>   - [pdfcrowd](https://pdfcrowd.com/html-to-pdf/#convert_by_upload)
>   - [web2pdfconvert](https://www.web2pdfconvert.com/html/to/pdf/)
